category: "Item Port Types"
intro: |
  - Each port is a 2x2 space in the middle of a block, and can be on all sides.
  - It's not labeled with a color since you can easily see if it uses water or hoppers.

      - Side Locations:

      Transports items using hoppers. Recommended to use bITEM on the sides as it is multidirectional. If you want speed, try to use ITEM-WATER instead of iITEM/oITEM-HOPPER when possible.
