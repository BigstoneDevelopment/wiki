category: "Redstone Port Types"
intro: |
  - Each port would have a corresponding colored concrete block under it.
  - Locations of the port holes are in (X, Y), in which (1, 1) is the bottom left block on a 16x16 face looking from the side of a chunk. _(Clarification: Port HOLES, not the concrete position)_
  - Some ports are "dangerously incompatible," meaning the port's position overlaps with a different, more prioritized port(s), which can cause issues when next to these ports.

ports:
  - name: BIN
    emoji: 🟥
    color: red
    madeBy: Daxis1
    status: Compliant
    location: "iBIN at (7, 2) - oBIN at (10, 2)"
    description: |
      The default port. Used to connect components together, and is the simplest port (as it does not preserve signal strength). These are made for speed.

  - name: HEX
    emoji: 🟦
    color: blue
    madeBy: gingrspacecadet
    status: Compliant
    location: "iHEX at (5, 2) - oHEX at (12, 2)"
    description: |
      A more advanced port. They preserve the signal strength from the output of the previous block. Useful for HEX calculations.
      Recommended to have iHEX next to an iBIN to ensure compatibility with other components (Make iBIN set the input on that side to 15 or 0 to convert it to HEX)

  - name: HEX-STATE
    emoji: 🟩
    color: green
    madeBy: "guigui, Spin4team4096"
    status: Compliant
    location: "iHEX-STATE at (5, 4) - oHEX-STATE at (12, 4)"
    description: |
      (Under development) Used to check the state of a component which is currently doing an operation. The component can decide what signal strength each state is. If a component decides multiple states counts as the same value it should pulse when changing between them to indicate the state has changed (But try avoid having multiple states output the same thing). (Examples: A comparator could return the value of the state; an observer can "observe" the state to know if it has changed). You could use this output to make your bigstone circuit do certain things!

  - name: HEX-2
    emoji: 🟨
    color: yellow
    madeBy: LimeLight
    status: Compliant
    location: |
      iHEX-2 at (7, 6) and (9, 6)
      oHEX-2 at (8, 6) and (10, 6)
    description: |
      Just like HEX, but carries double the amount of data, meaning it can carry 8 bits (1 byte) of data!

  - name: BIN-LR
    emoji: 🟦
    color: cyan
    madeBy: Spin4team4096
    status: Compliant
    location: |
      iBIN-LR at (2, 3) for 1st bit, and stack upwards for each additional bit.
      oBIN-LR at (14, 3) similarly stacks upwards.
    description: |
      Useful for computational components, especially since most computational circuits are vertical, so you can easily plug it right in!

  - name: BIN-8
    emoji: 🟧
    color: orange
    madeBy: LimeLight
    status: Semistandard
    location: "Coming soon (never)"
    description: |
      Carrys 8 bits of data, but is huge, so a wire can only be one way. However, it can be useful for speed over a long distance of wires, and can also save space within a component since you don't need to fit a HEX decoder inside your components if it uses BIN-8 instead.

      ⚠️ **Dangerously incompatible next to:** 🟥BIN, 🟦HEX, 🟦BIN-LR, 🟫RAIL

  - name: SOUND
    emoji: 🟪
    color: purple
    madeBy: "BastienA, Xoliks"
    status: Compliant
    location: "iSOUND at (7, 4) - oSOUND at (10, 4)"
    description: |
      A wireless port using sound and skulk sensors to transfer data.

  - name: RAIL
    emoji: 🟫
    color: brown
    madeBy: Spin4team4096
    status: Compliant
    location: "iRAIL at (8, 2) - oRAIL at (9, 2)"
    description: |
      The iRAIL is regular rail, and oRAIL is powered rail. This port can be used to transfer items (or mobs/players) using minecarts.

      ⚠️ **WARNING:** Make sure you put these next to components that use the same type of minecart. Otherwise minecart types can mix and cause issues.

  - name: WALK
    emoji: 🍋‍🟩
    color: lime
    madeBy: Parrot
    status: Compliant 
    location: "biWALK at (6, 2) and (11, 2)"
    description: |
      A port that allows entry and exit to components and mobs/players to be moved through a port without minecarts, useful for shorter distances and quick entry into components.
