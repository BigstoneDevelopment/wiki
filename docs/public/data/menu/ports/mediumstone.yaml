category: "Mediumstone Port Types"
intro: |
  - Mediumstone is a variant of Bigstone, but the components are 8x8x8 instead of 16x16x16.
  - They use the same colors as their Bigstone counterparts (to save color slots), but in different locations.
  - Since Mediumstone is a different system, overlapping ports with Bigstone is obvious and not included.
  - Many Medium ports overlap with other Medium ports as space is limited — these overlaps will be listed.
